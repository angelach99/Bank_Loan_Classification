# Bank_Loan_Classification
ECO421 Group Project, Spring 2021, @UofT

## Abstract
The majority of small businesses in the United States use loans in the form of credit from the Small Business Administration (SBA) to help their businesses grow. In 2019 alone, over 20.8 billion dollars has been lended out to small businesses across the United States in the form of an SBA loan, which shows how prevalent these loans are in fostering small business growth. In 2019, around 43% of small businesses applied for an SBA loan, and the overall average SBA loan amount is $107,000 (Shepherd, 2021), suggesting that a relatively large percentage of small businesses take on a significant amount of debt through SBA loans. Moreover, given that the failure rate for small businesses is around 50% in the 5th year of operation (Lewis, Daniel Lewis, 2021), and that around 17% of all SBA loans went into default from 2006 to 2015 (Voigt, 2020), it is important to predict what contributes to SBA loan default and to understand the top characteristics that contribute to default on SBA loans.
